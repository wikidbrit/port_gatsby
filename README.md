[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f578009c-ce87-4165-8bb4-55b502f93246/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/silly-brattain-a33c55/deploys)

Welcome to the repo for my personal portfolio page. This is my first real page to showcase the work/learning I have been doing at Hyper Island and beyond. My intention is to continue to improve and refine the page as I learn more and grow more confident in wed development.

Care to see the deployed site? [You will soon be able to view here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-starters/).
## 🔧 The Process

1.  **First Steps**

    I started with logo development based around some ideas and inspiration I had found. This process had me developing multiple logos, and creating multiple pages (not sure if I hid all the repos they are contained in). I finally settled on the idea towards the first half of 2021 and began the process of developing the design soon after. 
    <br>
2.  **Creating the Design**

    I created most of the logo assets and design guide in Adobe Illustrator, settling on the color pallette and font choices. These evolved some from the initial design but was mostly settled on early. <br>

    After the initial design stage I went into Figma and created the overall layout and created some simple rules to follow. This is always a key step for me so I can think less about the design and more troubleshooting when developing. <br>

3.  **Developing The Page**

    In the pursuit of learning I decided I wanted to use a headless CMS with Gatsby to create the page. I decided to go with the blog starter and quickly started deleting everything. I developed this site mobile first, which was the first for me. It helped speed up the development of the desktop site dramatically. <br>
    Contentful was my CMS of choice as I had used it before on a school project you can [view here](https://github.com/wikidbrit/c_c-Ricola) for Ricola. That at least gave me some familiarity with the site and how to integrate it into my page. <br>
    It has been a real learning experience and frankly struggle to get to this point and the project continues to grow as I learn more and more. 

## 🚗 Whats Coming Next

1. I need to make mockups for the portfolio projects. Those will be added to the CMS soon.
2. I would like to render buttons depending on if the information is available from the CMS. I have the basis of that figured out. 
3. There is more styling required for the project pages.
4. Animations!!
5. CMS content needs to be added and I need to narrow down the projects I plan to show.
6. Clean the repo some to remove the placeholder assets provided by Gatsby.

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
